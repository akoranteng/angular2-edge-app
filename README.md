# Developing an Angular 2 edge Application

## Requirements

To start the application you need the following installed:
 * Node
 * MongoDB

It's also easier if you have the following npm libraries installed globally:

* typescript
* typings
* gulp

## Set Up

To build the application run the following commands:
```
npm install
gulp build-dev
```

Once built you can start the server and database with `npm start` or if you have a mongo server already running, just run `npm run server`
